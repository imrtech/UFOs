# UFOs

### Overview of Project:

The purpose of this project was to use our knowledge of JavaScript to organize the UFO data into tables that can be filtered based on a user's selection. We used Javascript functions to loop through the data to build the table and to create a visual dashboard on an HTML page. We used event listeners to record the information once a change in an element occured. We built a filter search that would allow a user to search based on a date, city, state, country and shape. We also used Bootstrap and CSS to read the Javascript code and create a visually pleasing webpage with that can be easily read and searched.  

### Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria


### Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)
