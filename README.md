# UFOs

### Overview of Project:

The purpose of this project was to use our knowledge of JavaScript to organize the UFO data into tables that can be filtered based on a user's selection. We used Javascript functions to loop through the data to build the table and to create a visual dashboard on an HTML page. We used event listeners to record the information once a change in an element occured. We built a filter search that would allow a user to search based on a date, city, state, country and shape. We also used Bootstrap to help organize the webpage's content into containers, rows, and columns and used CSS to customize the font color and font size of the body and navigation bar. This created a visually pleasing webpage with light text and a dark background, that can be easily read and searched.  

### Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria


### Deliverable 2: A written report on the UFO analysis (README.md)

### Results:


- The user interface is a clean webpage.
- It contains a filter search that allows a user to select a date, cty, state, country and shape. The filter search records the selections and stores it in the table to it's right.
- The search results appear in a table with columns Date, City, State, Country, Shape, Duration and Comments.
